No arguing on that.\nBut apart from that, I also listen to a lot of Rock and Metal, like Sleep Token, Bring Me The Horizon, and so on.\nLinux\nI currently use Fedora as my daily driver, but my favorite is honestly Arch.\nThere’s a blog post about the reason I switched, if you’re interested.\nJust in case, here’s a list of the distros I’ve tried (in order):\n\nUbuntu\nKali\nArch\nEndeavourOS\nFedora (current)\n\nBlog\nI decided to take the path of blogging, as a way to share my thoughts and experiences. I don’t pretend to be interesting or anything, but I hope that somebody will find my content useful.\nOnline\nIf you ever wanna get in touch (or just stalk me), just take a look at this page.\nCredits\nThis is honestly the most important part for me. I really love the way the website looks, and that’s all thanks to Daudix for his beautiful theme Duckquill.\nHe helped me a lot with the customization, and with the things I didn’t understand about Zola.\nThe website is available on GitHub for whoever needs inspiration or is just curious.

Alright, seems cool.\n\n\t\n\t\tNote\n\tThis is actually the first post I write on this blog.\nI’m not even a native english speaker, and I’m not used to writing blog articles.\nI will get used to it with time, but don’t expect some quality content right now.\n\n\nLet’s talk about what the title itself says. I recently switched from Arch Linux to Fedora.\nThis will require me to talk a little more about the past…\nFirst Approach to Ubuntu\nWhen I was 5 y/o I had a little laptop with Ubuntu Desktop, I remember it was a very old version of Ubuntu, but I don’t remember which one.\nIt couldn’t run anything heavy but who cares, I was literally 5 years old or something.\nTime passed and new laptops came, they all had Windows, and I was fine with it. I even got my desktop computer (my current one) and used Windows 10/11 for years until last spring.\nRe-discovering Linux\nDuring the last 2 years I recently re-discovered linux by setting up a home-server with a friend, and I loved it.\nI learned how to use a terminal and learnt a lot about computers and hardware in general.\nOne day I meet a friend of my friend, and he was using Ubuntu Desktop on his laptop.\nI obviously made a lot of questions about it, and I discovered about how many distros there were, as long as Desktop Environments, and stuff like that.\nInstalling Arch\nBy scrolling on Reddit I found a post about an Arch Linux rice and got to research more about arch itself.\nI discovered that it was considered one of the “hardest” distros to install and use, and I was looking for a challenge.\nThe thing is, I installed it following the true Arch way, by making mistakes.\nTurns out that instead of installing arch as a dual-boot with Windows, I wiped out the entire Windows partition of my laptop and lost pretty much everything.\nI must say, thanks god OneDrive exists.\nUsing Arch\nI mean, the installation did go really well because I just used the Archinstall tool, and it worked, but even then, I was really confused.\nMy dumb ass decided to not select most of the options in the Archinstall TUI, so there was no Desktop Manager.\nI did manage how to install it eventually, with sudo pacman -S gnome.\nAt the end everything turned out great.\nI and the Arch Wiki became best friends, and I also learnt a lot about linux and machines in general.\nThe BIG Problem\nEverything was going fine, until a kernel update decided that my arch installation must not boot anymore.\nWithout talking about the issue too much, I’ll just let you know that 2 weeks ago (when this happened) I was very ill and I just wanted to use my PC for a bit, and I couldn’t because of this.\nAfter a while I got tired of my system’s mood swings, it seemed like it had menstruation.\nMonthly something would eventually break.\nI already know that’s Arch’s philosophy, and it was fun at the beginning until it got boring.\nThe Solution\nOne thing led to another, and I was just furious, so I installed Fedora.\nYou can’t imagine how happy I was to discover that Fedora came already in with my favorite DE, GNOME.\nI riced it a bit at the beginning, installed whatever I needed, and it was ready to go.\nConclusion\nI’m really happy with Fedora, but I miss Arch.\nI miss the AUR, the rolling release, the wiki, the community.\nBut seriously, getting used to the AUR is horrible.\nOnce you distro hop to a non-Arch distro, you eventually end up managing dnf repositories like I did, and it’s not fun at all.\nMaybe one day I’ll go back to Arch, but for now, I’m happy with my stable system, and it’s actually pretty fun.\nThat’s all for now, I’m going to bed. I hope you enjoyed this article, and I hope I’ll be making more in the future.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/from-arch-to-fedora/","title":"From Arch to Fedora"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/online/":{"body":"Hey, it’s still me!\nThis page is still WIP, I’m working on it.\nBut for now, you can find me on Discord or Matrix (my favorite).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/online/","title":"Online"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/":{"body":"Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:\n\nProject 1: Description of project 1.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/","title":"My Projects"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":164,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":30,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/from-arch-to-fedora/":{"body":369,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/online/":{"body":13,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/projects/":{"body":9,"title":1}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
