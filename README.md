# Mambuco's Website

This is my personal website! Visit [mambuco.dev](https://mambuco.dev/) and take a look.

It's built with Zola, a static site generator, and Ametrine, a Zola theme built by [Daudix](https://daudix.one/).

I'm okay with anybody taking inspiration from it, or even stealing some `.scss`/`.js` files. We all collaborate on the web, right?
Just, if you take **too much** inspiration, I'd be happy to be credited. That's your choice tho, don't feel like you have to.
