I listen to music every day, for hours. It makes me relax, hype, or whatever I need it to do. My favorite singer is **Billie Eilish**, she's helped me a lot. I also listen to **Sleep Token**, **Polyphia**, and many other Rock/Metal artists. **BUT** I'm currently obessed with J-pop and J-rock, especially Anime opening/ending themes.

I'm really passionate about design, especially **web design**.

A website can either be your home, your shop, your little showcase/portfolio, your diary, and so on. The internet has **no limit**. That's why I love it so much.
