I'd define myself as **mainly introverted**.

My personality type is `INFP-T`, you can understand a lot about me from that. I don't usually start a conversation unless **I'm confident with that person**, and I often like spending time **alone**.

I listen to music every day, for hours. It makes me relax, hype, or whatever I need it to do. My favorite singer is **Billie Eilish**, she's helped me a lot. I also listen to **Sleep Token**, **Polyphia**, and many other Rock/Metal artists. **BUT** I'm currently obessed with J-pop and J-rock, especially Anime opening/ending themes.

I love **Linux** and hate Windows. My main distro is currently **Arch Linux** <small>(btw)</small>.
