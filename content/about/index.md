Hey, it's me! We've got a lot to talk about, so let's get started.

My actual name is Gabriele, I'm Italian, and I love food. *I mean, who doesn't?*

I've got a few passions:

- [Linux](#linux)
- Coding (duh)
- Music
- [Games](#games-and-music)
- [Ricing](https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html/)

My favorite programming language is currently [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but the one I know the best is [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/).

## Games and Music

Some of my favorite videogames are:

- [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) (Skong)
- [Beat Saber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/)
- [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)
- [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/)
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/)
- FPS games in general

As for the music, Billie Eilish is my favorite. No arguing on that.

But apart from that, I also listen to a lot of Rock and Metal, like Sleep Token, Bring Me The Horizon, and so on.

## Linux

I currently use Vanilla OS as my daily driver, and I like it a lot.
There's a project about linux that I've started, take a look at the [Distropedia](@/distropedia/_index.md).

## Blog

I decided to take the path of [blogging](@/blog/_index.md), as a way to share my thoughts and experiences. I don't pretend to be interesting or anything, but I hope that somebody will find my content useful.
