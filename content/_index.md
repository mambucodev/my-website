# Welcome to My Website!

Hey! It's Mambuco here, your favorite developer. I'm just kidding, I'm not that famous. But I'm glad you're here!

We've got a lot to talk about, so let's get started.

## About Me

My actual name is Gabriele, I'm Italian and I love food. *I mean, who doesn't?*

I've got a few passions:

- [Linux](#linux)
- Coding (duh)
- Music
- [Games](#games-and-music)
- [Ricing](https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html/)

My favorite programming language is currently [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but the one I know the best is [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/).

### Games and Music

Some of my favorite videogames are:

- [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) (Skong)
- [Beat Saber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/)
- [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)
- [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/)
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/)
- FPS games in general

As for the music, Billie Eilish is my favorite. No arguing on that.

But apart from that, I also listen to a lot of Rock and Metal, like Sleep Token, Bring Me The Horizon, and so on.

### Linux

I currently use Fedora as my daily driver, but my favorite is honestly Arch.
There's a [blog post](@/blog/2025-02-04-from-arch-to-fedora/index.md) about the reason I switched, if you're interested.

Just in case, here's a list of the distros I've tried (in order):

- Ubuntu
- Kali
- Arch
- EndeavourOS
- Fedora (current)

### Blog

I decided to take the path of [blogging](@/blog/_index.md), as a way to share my thoughts and experiences. I don't pretend to be interesting or anything, but I hope that somebody will find my content useful.

### Online

If you ever wanna get in touch (or just stalk me), just take a look at [this page](@/online/index.md).

## Credits

This is honestly the most important part for me. I really love the way the website looks, and that's all thanks to [Daudix](https://daudix.one/) for his beautiful theme [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one/).

He helped me a lot with the customization, and with the things I didn't understand about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

The website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mambucodev/my-website/) for whoever needs inspiration or is just curious. (By the way, also thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deploying!)
