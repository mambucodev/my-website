## Commissions

Some of you may have come here because of my works (or at least I hope so {{ emoji(name="neofox_cry") }}). Well, in that case, I'm open to commissions.

If there's something you'd want like a website and don't know how to get it done, I can do it for just a couple bucks. I'm not doing this for money but for fun.

## Credits

This is honestly the most important part for me. I really love the way the website looks, and that's all thanks to [Daudix](https://daudix.one/) for his beautiful theme: [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one/).

He helped me a lot with the customization, and with the things I didn't understand about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

The website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mambucodev/my-website/) for whoever needs inspiration or is just curious. (By the way, also thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deploying!)

<small>Oh, and by the way, the image in the navbar (top left) is fetched from my Discord profile {{ emoji(name="neofox_book") }}</small>
