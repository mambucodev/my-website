Hey! It's Mambuco here, your favorite developer. I'm just kidding, I'm not that famous. But I'm glad you're here! {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

## Online

If you ever wanna get in touch (or just stalk me), just take a look at [this page](@/online/index.md).

## Credits

This is honestly the most important part for me. I really love the way the website looks, and that's all thanks to [Daudix](https://daudix.one/) for his beautiful theme: [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one/).

He helped me a lot with the customization, and with the things I didn't understand about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

The website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mambucodev/my-website/) for whoever needs inspiration or is just curious. (By the way, also thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deploying!)

<small>Oh, and by the way, the image above is fetched from my Discord profile {{ emoji(name="neofox_book") }}</small>
