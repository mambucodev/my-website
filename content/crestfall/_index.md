Hi, and welcome to **Crestfall**! {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

The server is currently <span id="online-indicator"><noscript>NO:JS</noscript></span>.

<div id="offline-message" class="hidden">

We're sorry, but the server is currently unreachable. It's probably either rebooting, under maintenance, or just not working at the moment.

If the server is **Offline** for too long, feel free to [contact me](@/socials/index.md) and let me know.

Seems like you have JavaScript disabled, and that's great!

If you had scripts enabled, you would have seen an **Online/Offline** indicator and a **players list** instead of this paragraph, in this spot.

<strong class="title">What's Crestfall?</strong>

It's a **Minecraft** vanilla-like server.

The server is a **Fabric** instance, with [server-side mods](@/crestfall/mods/index.md) only.
