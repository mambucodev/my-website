**Hey, it's still me!** In case you want to get in touch with me, see what I do, publish, or say, this is the page you're looking for!

<details>
<summary>What about popular Social Media?</summary>

I've been avoiding most socials like TikTok, Instagram and others lately. The simple fact is that spending time on those platforms is completely wasted time **in my opinion**. I'm okay with how anybody chooses to spend their time, but this is my personal choice.

<small>I'm still on some platforms like Mastodon, Discord and a few more. Take a look below! ↓</small>

## Socials

In Rome it's currently <time id="clock"><noscript>NO:JS</noscript></time> <small>(UTC+1)</small> and I'm <span id="online-indicator"><noscript>N/A</noscript></span>.

<small>↓ You can reach me out on any of these platforms, even privately.</small>
