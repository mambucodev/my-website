**Hey, it's still me!** In case you want to get in touch with me, see what I do, publish, or say, this is the page you're looking for!

<details class="socials-aside">
<summary>{{ icon(name="question") }} What about other Social Media?</summary>

I *do* have an account on Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter), and other platforms. I just choose to not use them as I **don't** support the direction they're going. They were created for user entertainment, but now it's just bloated advertisement and propaganda. I prefer to be active on a platform where you can actually see interesting content.

There's also the fact that most big corp SNSs are grabbing a lot of data. And you know where all that data is going, right? While it seemed a joke a few years ago, it's been proved now that AI gets a lot of training data and it's not only from scientists but from **us** too. I then realised that I'm not gonna die if I don't follow the crowd.

<small>I'm still on some platforms like Mastodon, Discord and a few more. Take a look below! {{ icon(name="arrow-down") }}</small>
