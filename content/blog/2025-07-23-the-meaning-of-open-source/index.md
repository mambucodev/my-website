<details id="tracks">
<summary>Tracks</summary>

From now on I'm mentioning the music I'm listening to while writing every article.

I highly suggest reading while listening to these tracks (or the author) to be on the same wavelength I was at the time of publishing. You're not forced to, it's a thing you can do if you're a regular on my website and enjoy what I say.

For this article, I listened to **Billie Eilish**. I don't have any specific tracks list to give you because I played the author on shuffle. **BUT** if you want something specific, play her <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://album.link/i/1440898929/">**dont smile at me**</a> EP.

Here we go again... How have you been? Tonight I want to talk about open-source. That's it.

{% alert(note=true) %}

If you don't know much about open-source, you can learn a lot from this article. I'm going deep into the meaning of why is open-source important, and why some people hate it.

{% end %}

## Why Tho?

I don't really know. I had a conversation with a friend... when was it, 2 days ago? Anyway, he was telling me that by making my stuff open-source I'll never achieve anything, and that somebody could steal my code anytime, license or not.

I obviously told him that whatever I put out publicly is for people to use and see. It made me think tho, why do I **actually** love open-source?

## Definition

Before writing this article I chose to look up the definition of open-source. [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/open%20source/) says:

> <strong class="title">open-source</strong>
>
> Relating to source code that is available to the public without charge. Open-source code is often enhanced, improved, and adapted for specific purposes by interested programmers, with the revised versions of the code are made available to the public. For example, most of the code in the Linux operating system is open-source.

In a simple way, open-source code is free software available for people to use, edit, re-distribute, and many other things based on your license. **This means** it's basically volounteer work.

But that's only one way to see it. If we just thought of open-source as something you're giving to the public for free, it would sound kind of negative. Who whould want to mantain a project constantly just for people to be able to fork it, improve it and get all the fame? Obviously there's something deeper than this.

## Free Software

I'd like to first talk about free software, because we obviously know that there's a difference between free software and open-source software.

Let's be transparent: we all need free software. Not just software, but digital content at all. The **digital era** has given us a lot of possibilites in the field of communication, logic, transport, and more. A lot of jobs now require tech knowledge as a side or even main requirement (e.g. software engineers).

We already live in a world where everything material must be earned trough hard work. What about everything digital? Is it fair to make somebody pay 20$/month for an application, something that has already been developed and that has no cost of distribution?

All those questions are valid, but either we find an answer or not, nothing's going to change. But one thing is sure: not everybody can afford professional software.

### Design

I'll take the Adobe stack as an example. We all know how much it costs; a lot. Only those who work with Adobe software on a professional level can afford it.

But it's paradoxical: what if I need a logo? Why am I forced to pay either Adobe or a designer to have a logo? That's where the free software comes in. Think about apps like **GIMP**, **Inkscape**, **Krita** and many others; these applications allow common people to make their own graphics without having to spend money ~~or take the path of piracy~~.

### Piracy

{% alert(warning=true) %}

With this paragraph I'm not saying that piracy is good. It's not. It's illegal and unethical. But it's also a reality. And it's a reality that we have to deal with.

{% end %}

There's something I read somewhere on Twitter from **Hakita**, ULTRAKILL's developer:

> You should support indies if you can, but culture shouldn't exist only for those who can afford it. ULTRAKILL wouldn't exist if I hadn't had easy access to movies, music and games growing up.
>
> If you don't have money, you can support via word of mouth.
> 
> <small><a class="external" href="https://x.com/HakitaDev/status/1797245014268891236">See post</a></small>

Why does piracy exist? To download paid content for free, obviously. But why do we do it?

It's the same thing I was telling you before. Most of us don't think it's fair to make people pay for digital content. Content that can be distributed at an infinite about. **I'm not saying everything should be free obviously**, developers still need an income to live afterall.

But is it bad if some of us download some stuff *through piracy*? As Hakita confessed, he himself streamed music and movies for free, and he calls those **culture**.

I agree, culture shouldn't be exclusive to those who can afford it. That's why some countries (e.g. Italy) have public schools: places where students can have an education for free. Thing is, schools only provide one side of the overall education a student needs. We can't see movies at school, nor listen to music or play videogames, because those activities belong **at home**.

**I'm not saying piracy is good**, but I'm saying it's not bad either. It's a matter of perspective.

- If you're a developer, you should be happy that people are downloading your content for free.
- If you're a musician, you should be happy that people are listening to your music for free.
- If you're a movie producer, you should be happy that people are watching your movies for free.

Quoting Hakita again, as I strongly agree with his POV: "If you don't have money, you can support via word of mouth." There's multiple ways of helping an author grow, not only money. Word of mouth is more powerful than you probably think it is.

## Open-Source

Free software is fun and all, but what about **sharing your code too**?

Let's just talk about software again. Wouldn't it just be okay to distribute the compiled result of your project and let people use it? **It depends.**

**In my opinion**, sharing your code means being transparent about your work. You're honest, you show people there's nothing sketchy behind your application. And when your software is free but people still feel like contributing, now they can.

But that's the **sharing** point of view. What if **we**'re the one accessing someone else's code? This gives us opportunities to learn, take inspiration, and copy/paste some snippets when the license allows it. It's a way to give back to the community and contribute to the growth of the open-source ecosystem.

## Licensing

> Licensing is a crucial aspect of open-source software. It defines the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed. There are various types of licenses, each with its own set of rules and restrictions. Some popular open-source licenses include the MIT License, Apache License, and GNU General Public License (GPL).

Obviously, open-source brings many risks such as somebody copying your code without giving you any credit, and either:

- Earning money off your project without your consent
- Taking all the credit for your work

Licenses usually cover this kind of issues, because as long as a LICENSE file is present in your code source (usually a git repository) all the code inside of it is affected. People accessing your code must comply to it, and if they don't, they risk legal action.

## Earning

Open-source projects have no income, that's obvious. That's the only sad part of it, that everybody is legally allowed to download your work and you're not getting a dime for it.

*There is a way*, and that's usually by receiving donations trough Ko-fi or just companies supporting you; for example, Red Hat and Canonical supporting Torvalds with the development of Linux.

Tho I wouldn't recommend doing open-source for a living, unless you're part of a big corporation like GNOME. Sharing code to the public is most of the times just a hobby, not a job. A way to show your capabilities, to contribute to the community, and to learn from others.

For a startup, you'd prefer a closed-source project. You wouldn't want anybody copying your idea, right? Not your code either.

## Conclusion

I felt something different writing this article. I'm not writing about me this time, but about society. About the world we live in, corporations, developers all around the world.

A lot of questions came up, most of them weren't answered. That's *kind of* how it's supposed to be. I don't have a personal answer that I would give to all of those, not yet at least.

I aknowledge that many things I wrote may not sound right to **a lot** of people. I'd like to hear them out tho. <small>Maybe in the comments.</small>

That said, see ya in the next article! {{ emoji(name="neofox_heart") }}
