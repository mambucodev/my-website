<small>Banner is **Marin Kitagawa**, a scene from My Dress-Up Darling S2 (which is currently airing this summer).</small>

Hey, I'm so happy to see you here!

Today I want to try something different. No techy stuff, just me. But not my thoughtful me like in the last article.

You'll discover something new, my **otaku** side! You may have already seen it somewhere around fedi, on my [alt account](https://sakurajima.moe/@mambuco/), but this time you're getting a full presentation! {{ emoji(name="neofox_heart") }}

By the way, if you don't know what anime is, just know you've probably watched a few where you were young. Do you remember Doraemon, Dragon Ball or maybe One Piece? These "cartoons" are all japanese **animations**, perhaps called anime. <small>Don't ever call animes "cartoons" in front of an anime lover, he'll probably attack you, 'cause they are **NOT** cartoons.</small>

## Where Do We Begin?

I'd still like to do what I always do, bring back some memories from the past.

I began watching Anime around 2021, with my first one being **Darling in the FranXX**. This was because of a friend I had, who was really appassionate about anime and still is. I liked it so much that I kept rewatching it every year, *funny right?*

<aside>

<strong class="title">What's an Otaku?</strong>

It's basically a japanese word to describe somebody either obsessed with Anime, Manga, Waifus, Light Novels, or others cultures from Japan. We use it too, in a very light way, to describe usually an Anime or Manga enthusiast.

</aside>

By the way for a few years I kept watching some anime, but not that much. Until a few months ago the only ones I had seen were:

- Darling in the FranXX
- Death Note
- Your Name.
- Demon Slayer
- My Dress-Up Darling
- Chainsaw Man

I really didn't watch that many. I blame my age, I was still very young and couldn't recognize **true peak**.

## After a While...

Last year (2024) I got to know more the asian culture. That summer I went to **South Korea** for two weeks and visited **Seoul**, **Busan** and **Jeju**. I loved that trip with all of my heart, and while I walked around the streets I was listening to... *guess what?* **Japanese music!**

I actually think I know the reason about that. You know that feeling when you watch a Movie or TV Series and don't have anybody to talk to about it? **That's how I felt.** That's the feeling I had when I watched those animes listed above. Until I met some new friends who were interested in anime like I was, and we got to recommend each other a thing or two.

This kind of brought me back to anime, as without someone to talk to I had almost lost interest in it.

## What about Manga?

<details>

<summary>What's a "Manga"?</summary>

I admit mangas are less known than anime. They're comics, to make it simple. Japanese comics, and they have a unique way to be read.

They're not comics made for kids. Actually, a lot of manga are **NOT** recommended for kids. They're read from right-to-left, and the illustration boxes too are read the same way. <small>And the same goes for the dialog bubbles.</small>

They're divided in volumes, and then in chapters. Most animes are an animated adaptation or a manga. For example One Piece, Chainsaw Man, the Monogatari Series, and many others. *Sometimes, there can also be a manga adapted from an anime.*

Technically there's also Light Novels I should talk about, but **let's leave it for another time.** *Right?*

<small>Oh by the way, one manga can cost around `5-7â‚¬`. Pricy, huh...</small>

</details>

When was it... *maybe two years ago?* Oh yeah now I remember.

Around 2023 I found a really nice manga shop in Rome. There's not many around here, so I wanted to take a look around. I swear, it was amazing. So amazing that I actually wanted to **buy something**.

My first manga ever was **Your Name.** I had already seen the anime, so I knew the manga wouldn't let me down, and it didn't. There's one thing do I did wrong: I thought that it wouldn't be as exciting as the anime.

**I was wrong.** Yeah there's no animations on a manga, but there's movement, and plenty of it. I understimated how illustrations are actually capable of catching your attention and showing you things that usually woldn't be possible to see on a piece of paper.

The artstyle was amazing, and the fact that it hit me so hard emotionally was also really surprising. So I chose to buy another one: **One Piece**.

As of today I own 10 volumes of One Piece, and 12 of Chainsaw Man.

## How It Evolved

So, you know, around 3 months ago (April 2025) I got **too much** into anime and manga.

I began watching all type of anime, every day. The genre that prevails right now is <abbr title="romantic stuff">**rom-coms**</abbr>. There's no way I'm gonna list them all because they're too many.

The thing is, they took **5-8 hours** of my time, **every day**. It was truly an obsession, something I couldn't live without. Part of the reason is, I was going trough a bad time (and I still kinda am). I needed something to cope, and this distracted to my overall issues and responsibilities.

I did know it was kind of an unhealthy and brain-rotting habit, but it only got worse. <small>Oh by the way I'm really proud of it.</small> They grew, from 8 to **10-13 hours** daily. This means 20-30 episodes (24~ minutes each).

I was indeed locked in this cycle for a while. Eventually I started to do other things such as gaming and coding, so my watchtime decreased to just a few hours a-day. *No issue with that, right?*

### My Kindle

I'd like my Kindle to have a special mention into this.

I bought a kindle two weeks ago, with the only purpose of reading manga. Physical volumes cost too much, and I can't support that kind of lifestyle yet. So I eventually wrote some code to convert manga scans into **kindle-supported files**, and transferred them via USB.

It's really nice, it feels like paper and it's light. I don't have a tablet to read, and my laptop was kind of uncomfortable to bring around *you know*? My phone wasn't a great solution either as it's both too little and too heavy at the same time.

E-ink displays really save your eyesight. They keep that paper-like sensation, without any blue light at all keeping you awake. You can read a whole book and actually be tired afterwards, without your brain producing hormones because of a stupid LCD display.

I think I may talk about my experience with my Kindle in another blog article someday, when I get the actual hang of it.

## Conclusion

I don't resent any of this, I'm actually really proud of it. It's not like some important milestone or something, but there's one thing that always kind of weighted on me. As an *otaku*, I only watched a few animes until a few months ago. People around me were chatting about things I didn't know, and it got on my nerves.

I hyperfocused for a few months, and watched most of the anime people like to talk about. I can now join those conversations and actually be seen as an *"experienced"* anime watcher.

Saying this makes me recognize it sounds stupid, but as somebody with social anxiety, I can assure you it's not. Everybody has their own passion, and this is mine. We're not even in the age where people can make fun of anime. Didn't Netflix recently announce that approximately **50% of its users** watch anime across their platform? And romantic animes (like the one in the banner above) are really common.

Anyways, I feel like posting many articles about the Anime I watch, along the [tech](/tags/tech/)-related ones. Thanks for reading, I hope you can leave either your opinion or your experience in the comments, I'd be happy about it. {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

**See ya next time!**
