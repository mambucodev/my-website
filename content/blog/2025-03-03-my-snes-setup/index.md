Hey, looks like we meet again. Or maybe not, in case you're new here.

This post is going to be about why I've been **rediscovering retro games** lately, and also why I'm having **more fun with them than modern games** at the moment.

## The Downfall of Modern Games

Wherever you turn these days, you can probably see a new game being published by one of the big game companies out there.

But the thing is, most of the time it's just **old game ideas being recycled**.

I don't think that's entirely their fault.

But that's not the only reason why I think modern games just **don’t have the same feel as retro or indie games**.

## How the SNES Solved My Issue

A few years ago (2017), Nintendo made a modernised version of the old Super Nintendo from the 90s.

It was one of Nintendo’s first consoles, and they wanted to honour it by making a smaller, HDMI-enabled console with all the games pre-installed.

Oh, and it’s powered by MicroUSB—*talk about a small upgrade!*

I bought one and **discovered all the games my parents played when they were young**.

And that **low-quality, retro, pixelated collection of video games gave me a very different feeling** to Minecraft, Fortnite, etc.

Sure, it doesn’t support multiplayer.

Sure, it doesn’t have a decent gamepad.

But hey, it’s got co-op and you can play:

- **Mario Kart (the very first)**

- **Street Fighter II Turbo**

- **The Legend of Zelda (can’t remember which one)**

And lots of other games.

## Consequences

Now I’m **spending a lot of time on the SNES instead of TikTok, Instagram Reels and all that crap**.

At least now I’m doing something that’s **more fun and will leave a fond memory in my heart**.

But let’s talk about REAL consequences.

Trying most of the games on the SNES made me think that I should eventually **try other retro games outside of that little grey box**.

And that’s where my gaming PC comes in.

*Emulators: the way to a happier life.*

Now, I’m certainly not going to emulate current consoles.

But I think Nintendo wouldn’t mind if I sandboxed some of their old retro games that are no longer playable.

## Conclusion

**Retro games are fun**, even if it’s subjective.

I’m the kind of person who likes retro stuff in general, so **seeing video games that are older than me makes me kind of happy**.

Most people wouldn’t agree with me, but I feel like the audience of this blog will actually understand what I’m trying to say.

That said, I’ll probably post something more at the end of my “retro games journey”.

But for now, this may be the end.

I’ve had a lot of fun writing this post, and I hope you’ll enjoy checking out the rest of my blog.
