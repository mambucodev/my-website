<summary>Tracks</summary>

This time, I'm listening to [Lo-files](https://album.link/i/1821917950) by **Bring Me The Horizon**. It's an album with lo-fi versions of their most famous songs, which give you both chilling and exciting vibes. The same vibes I had while living the experience that I'm about to narrate.

During the hike itself I didn't have earbuds, so I didn't listen to any music. But I didn't have to, 'cause listening to the nature surrounding you while traveling has no substitutes.

</details>

As the title suggests, I went on a hike! Well, not that recently... From the **2nd** to the **7th** of August! <small>Actually, the 2nd I participated at the youth day and actually departed the 3rd, so...</small>

{% alert(warning=true) %}

This article depicts an arch linux user and anime otaku touching **grass**. Not just touching, but also walking and sleeping on it, for several days. There are also pictures of it.

If you're sensitive about the topic, we advise you to exit the article and go read another one about either linux, gaming or anime.

{% end %}

## Pre-Hike

Before actually departing, I participated to the **international youth day** which was held in **Rome**&mdash;my hometown. It was a really heartwarming experience.

{% alert(note=true) %}

Most of you do not know but I'm a scout. Not a boyscout (that's american stuff, I'm not involved with it), just a scout. More specifically, I'm part of the **International Union of Guides and Scouts of Europe**, shortened as **FSE**. We're also catholic, this should explain what I'm gonna say next.

{% end %}

I'm gonna keep this short, as it's not the main topic of the article but we basically reunited (we as in 1.5M+ christians) in **Tor Vergata**&mdash;a place in Rome&mdash;and slept there until the next day. There was the pope with us and the people were from all over the world. I got to talk to some really nice spanish girls, and some korean guys. It's an experience that you don't get to live very often, and the religious part of it made it even better.

By the way, about the hike: I'd like to share with you the original <a class="external" href="https://www.outdooractive.com/it/route/escursione-di-piu-giorni/provincia-di-roma/campo-v2-clan-la-fenice/316924242/?share=%7E3iq7dgnm%244ossntsg">plan</a>, keep it in mind because there's gonna be a looooooot of detours.

## Highlights

![Landscape](landscape.webp#end)

I'm not gonna separate the article in "days", as it wouldn't be interesting enough. There was no concept of time out there, I only remember the places we went to each day but we have pictures for that. I'm actually gonna talk about the experience, stuff that happened, buildings we visited, all this without a precise order hopefully.

The beginning was very harsh. You see, we planned this hike ahead of months, and we overstimated our capabilities. The total length was ment to be 60 kilometers more or less, pretty normal, but the actual issue was the **slope**. We didn't pay too much attention to the altitude and managed to follow the planned route for the **first day**.

Imagine this: it's the next day and you're already tired from the day before; you then spend half a day going up a steep climb, and after lunch you look at a really high mountain in front of you (the one in the banner on top by the way). You then quickly check the route on your phone and&mdash;UH?!

I immediately said: "Guys... bad news. Can you see that mountain in front of us? Yeah, we've gotta climb that". {{ emoji(name="neofox_x_x") }}

### The Infinite Forest

As you may guess, we immediately chose to detour and find another path for our daily destination. There was no way we would be able to climb that mountain and be alive afterwards.

![Infinite Forest](infinite-forest.webp#start)

Do you see this forest? This was our detour. A calm, downhill forest that would have brought us directly to our resting place.

What we didn't know is that this forest seemed to **never end**. We walked, and we walked... it was always the same. Like an infinite corridor. We traveled at least **10 kilometers** and the trees **never changed**, nor the ground did. We couldn't see the sky clearly as the leaves covered the top, and at a certain point I was starting to **go crazy**. {{ emoji(name="neofox_googly_shocked") }}

We eventually got out of the forest and only walked 2 kilometers to reach our destination. But still, that was pretty crazy.

### Bus Rides

From the 3rd day on going we didn't trust our own route anymore. We already walked more or less `40km` on the first **2 days** and preferred to actually take it calmly. It's okay to have a challenging hike, but it doesn't make sense if the pleasure has to be compromised. <small>Wait, does this go against something I said in the previous article...?</small>

By the way we walked to the nearest bus stop every morning and decided to cut some part of walking. We enjoyed the nature and talking to the people we met. We even stopped at a little water stream and submerged our feet in it! {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

### Sanctuaries

![Kindle](kindle.webp#end)

As the good christians we are, we also visited some churches. 2 of them even gave us a place to sleep!

Our 4th day was completely dedicated to guided trips, and a few other things that scouts do (not gonna say it as it's off-topic). We had much more time to rest, and I invested that time into reading. I brought my Kindle and managed to read the whole novel I downloaded just before departing. Cool, right?

As we didn't do much, there isn't anything I can say either. But wait 'till I get to the **last day**.

### Canyoning

<small>I just figured that I actually managed to separate the article in days. I genuinely thought I couldn't do that.</small>

Jokes on you, the 5th day we took a bus! A bus to our final destination. "But why? Wasn't this a hike?" It was meant to be, yeah. But our "scout heads" (basically the adults that guide young scouts during the year) had a surprise for us, and as the title suggest it was **Canyoning**.

> In case you don't know, while canyoning you're basically tied to a rope and you walk down cliffs and inside waterfalls.
> Quoting Wikipedia: "Canyoning is a sport that involves traveling through canyons using a variety of techniques, such as walking, scrambling, climbing, jumping, abseiling, swimming, and rafting."

The water was freezing (btw I like it) and we had a lot of fun. We could run, push each other, dive from cliffs and so on.

## Conclusion

![Monster Energy](monster.webp#end#spoiler)

To be honest, it's refreshing. At a certain point I stopped caring about the pain and tiredness, and just went on walking and having fun. Yes, because it's fun. To go away from home several days, with no technology apart from my iPhone (which I couldn't charge very often) in the middle of nowhere. And most importantly, it was a great way to spend time with friends.

If there's a scout group in your zone, I suggest you give it a try. There's also non-religious groups, don't worry. The idea of walking may scare you but I assure you that I'm the laziest person on earth and still survived more than **60 kilometers** those days.

That's it, I hope you liked a different type of content. Here's a pic of me drinking a monster energy on the last day of route, bye! {{ emoji(name="neofox_box") }}
