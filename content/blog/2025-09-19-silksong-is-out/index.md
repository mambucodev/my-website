<details>
<summary>Tracks</summary>

This time, I've been listening to Silksong's [soundtracks](https://album.link/i/1838949732). You know, to match the vibes and bring back that game feeling at the time of writing.

You're not forced to listen to them while reading, but they're pretty good. Because the article is not very long, I prefer to actually begin with [Choral Chambers](https://song.link/i/1838951597) as I think it's the best soundtrack so far.

</details>

If you follow me on fedi, you probably know about my obsession for **Hollow Knight**. I tried it out, like, 1 year ago and loved it. Now, after 7 years of development heaven, we've got a sequel!

## Release Date

Before actually talking about the game itself, I want to bring an important topic. **The wait.** I've been waiting for so long, and Team Cherry was so concentrated on building the game that they didn't give any announcement or additional info these years. Some of the reasons are to avoid spoilers, and because they didn't want to give any false signals about the game's release date.

Thing is, they announced the release date exactly 2 WEEKS before it came out (21 August 2025) with a trailer on YouTube. Therefore there was a total mess. People playing Hollow Knight for the first time so that they could then play Silksong, or even Indie Developers that planned to publish their own game on September.

Me and other fellow players waited so long for it, and we finally got it. **Silksong came out.**


## The Time of Purchase

You know, Silksong has been the most whitelisted and awaited game for years thanks to the fact that **Team Cherry** postponed the release of the game multiple times, and hollow knight was a great success after all. The music, the graphics, everything of it was astounishing to indie developers and whatnot.

No preorders, no early access for reviewers. The game was published on the **4th of September** at `7:00 PT` on all game stores and even made them **crash**. Exactly. Steam, Nintendo, Playstation and apparently Xbox too crashed exactly in that moment. I was there, refreshing my Steam page trying to add it to the cart but didn't manage for **over 2 hours**.

Eventually I bought it, after a lot of pain and suffering&mdash;oh and it costed ONLY 20 DOLLARS. Silksong already had over **half a million** players online on Steam after only 10 minutes after it came out. I think this beats some records, or at least gives the game a special throne between some of the best games ever.

{% alert(fact=true) %}

When the game came out I was on Discord with a friend. He managed to buy it in like 15 minutes, while I had to wait like 2 and a half hours... This tells you how messed up the servers were. They didn't even shut down, they were just hella confused because of all the people purchasing and downloading the game.

{% end %}

## "The Game Is Too Hard"

You may have heard about a lot of players complaining about the game being hard. After all, Hollow Knight was already **hard as fuck** and Silksong was not going to be any easier.

Well, you see, I'd like to say something to those people: NO SHIT. It's literally a sequel of one of the hardest metroidvania out there, did you expect them to release an easy and chill game after 7 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT?

{{ image(url="./git-gud.webp#end", alt="git gud meme") }}

**I'm glad it's difficult.** That's how a game should be, hard. Did people really prefer a game that could be finished in a couple days? NO. You're gonna get to the end, go trough all the 3 ACTS of the game, then 100% it and train yourself for the Steel Soul mode (which is a hardcore mode, you can't die).

At the time of writing, I haven't even finished the game yet. I plan on playing for at least a year, first finishing my main run and then playing again and again until I can do **Steel Soul**.

## Git Gud

Why are silksong players so afraid to improve? I've seen people complaining and ragequitting after the 3rd try. Do you know how many tries [Moorwing](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Moorwing) took me? At least 30 and I'm not ashamed of it because at the end I managed to beat him and actually got better at the game.

It takes a lot of concentration and skill. Something that AAA games do not require nowadays, and I'll tell you the reason:

My friends often ask me to buy a game to play together, and you know what's the thing that always convinces me? "man, look at the graphics!". That's what they always say. And what do I do? I buy it, of course.

We stopped caring about soundtracks, story, map exploring. We no longer look into the little details unless it's about graphics, and hollow knight has actually taught me **how to play games**. Both <abbr title="Hollow Knight">HK</abbr> and <abbr title="Silksong">SS</abbr> are full of hidden rooms, breakable walls, easter eggs, unnoticeable details that require you a lot of experience to notice.

In my opinion, patience is no longer normalized in games. And that's kind of *similar* to what's happening with socials and doomscrolling. We want content, we want it short and we want it rapidly. Most popular games nowadays just have a basic storyline, no deviations, no complicated lore, just a simple game. They spend millions of dollars on it, and only focus on delivering it to the public.

**Team Cherry** actually did something different here. If you don't know why they took **so much** to deliver Silksong I'll tell you why: they were in **development heaven**. This means that they were having so much fun building and expanding the game that they didn't want to publish it yet.

## The Game Itself

What do I think about the game? After all, this is a review about Silksong.

It's objectively good. **Christopher Larkin** composed some **beautiful** soundtracks that really soothe your soul while playing. The lore itself is not complicated at all, you get to understand what's going on in **Pharloom** step by step while advancing through the game. The graphics are exactly what I expected from them, a pure pleasure to look at.

I'm also in love with the new movement. The [Knight](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Knight) had some really basic controls, while the new [Crests](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Category:Crests_and_Skills) allow the player to customize their entire experience and playthrough.

## Conclusion

If you haven't played Silksong or Hollow Knight, please give them a try. They will be hard at first, but you'll understand what I'm saying once you fully live the **Team Cherry** experience like I am doing right now.

This is both a review and a venting article, because I really can't stand those people quitting and bad-reviewing the game because it's "hard". Just get better, improve, don't quit every time you encounter a new boss. Or if you ragequit, do like I do: come back after a few hours. I'll assure you that by taking a good nap, doing other stuff throughout the day, you'll be able to come back to the game with a fresh perspective and a better understanding of the boss mechanics.

That said, if you ever plan on playing Silksong because of my article or have any questions **please let me know**, I'd be so happy to find out that this was actually useful to someone. <small>With "let me know" I mean in the comments, obviously.</small>

Have a nice day! {{ emoji(name="neofox_heart") }}
