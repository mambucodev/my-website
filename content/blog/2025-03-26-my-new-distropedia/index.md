{% alert(warning=true) %}
*I still need to make a banner, but imagine a lot of distro logos in a circle and... and maybe a compass... in the centre. That's the idea.*
{% end %}

Get ready, because you're about to read a lot of interesting stuff (at least I hope so) about **Linux**, and about **me**.

{% alert(important=true) %}
If you don't know what Linux is, it's basically a computer operating system like **Windows** and **MacOS** (from Apple Macs).

Do I suggest you read this article? *I'm not sure.* The thing is that this blog is probably going to go into technical details about OSes, distros, software, and all that nerdy stuff.

I'm not saying you won't **enjoy** it, but you probably won't understand a lot of it without some basic knowledge of Linux.
{% end %}

Now, let's look at the definition of **Distropedia**.

## What's the Distropedia?

The Distropedia is a new project I've been thinking about lately. I've been trying out a few distros lately―there's a new article about a new distro coming soon―and I realised that I could make this my hobby in my spare time.

So, the Distropedia is a new section of this website where you will find information about every Linux distro I have tried. I'm probably going to rank them, or list pros and cons about them.

Don't think of it as a wiki or anything, it's more like a [Wanderer's Journal](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Wanderer%27s_Journal) (little <abbr title="Hollow Knight">HK</abbr> reference). A diary, where I'll be both technical about linux aspects and theoretical, talking about how I feel about using it.

## The Criteria

I'm obviously **NOT** going to install every distro as my daily driver because I'd be ~~suicidial~~ after trying them all. I'll use the great [GNOME Boxes](https://apps.gnome.org/Boxes/) application to sandbox them.

Most people will say that to discover a distro's true capabilities, you need to use it in its entirety, not just for a few specific tasks. I agree with that, so I'm going to write down some **criteria** to follow every time I try a new distro.

What do I mean by criteria? Just a list of things to try out before you give feedback on the distro itself. Some of these crieteria might be

- Writing code
- Launching games
- Listening to music
- Other stuff (See [#suggestions](@/distropedia/_index.md#suggestions))

## Which Distros?

Obviously I can't try every Linux distro on the planet, so I'm going to pick the most popular ones + the ones that any of you want.

I'm open to just about anything, so let's start with

- Debian
- Red Hat
- ~~Arch Linux~~

{% alert(note=true) %}
Q: *Why not Arch?*
A: **It was my first distro** and I've been using it for months. [Here](@/blog/2025-02-04-from-arch-to-fedora/index.md)'s why I quit, but it was a wonderful experience.
{% end %}

I'll continue with Debian-based distros and so on with Red Hat/Arch-based distros.

By the way there's a [roadmap](@/distropedia/roadmap/index.md) if you're interested.

## Conclusion

The [Distropedia](@/distropedia/_index.md) tab should now appear in the sidebar. There you'll find all the distros that have been tried so far, a roadmap, and a link to this article.

Again, if you have any suggestions please read this [section](@/distropedia/_index.md#suggestions) to understand how you can contribute.

{% alert(fact=true) %}
Thank you, really. This website helps me get trough a lot of things. You probably can't read about all the difficulties someone is going trough in one article.

That's why I really appreciate everyone who reads my blog light-heartedly. It helps me more than you can imagine.

See ya!
