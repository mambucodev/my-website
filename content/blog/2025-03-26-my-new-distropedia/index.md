Prepare, because you're going to read a lot of interesting stuff (at least I hope) about **Linux**, and about **me**.

{% alert(important=true) %}
If you don't know what Linux is, it's basically a computer Operating System like **Windows** and **MacOS** (from Apple Macs).

Now, do I suggest you reading this article? *I'm not sure.* The thing is that this blog post will probably go into technical details about OSes, distros, software, and all that nerdy stuff.

I'm not saying you can't **enjoy** this <abbr title="Blog Post (from Snug Nook)">blost</abbr>, but that you'll probably not understand many things without some basic knowledge about Linux.
{% end %}

Now, let's get into the definition of **Distropedia**.

## What's the Distropedia?

The Distropedia is a new project I've been thinking about lately. I've tried a few distros lately―by the way, a new article about a new distro is coming soon―and I realised I could make it my free time hobby.

So, the Distropedia is a new section of this website where you will find info about every linux distro I tried. I'm probably going to rank them, or list pros and cons about them.

Don't think of it like a wiki or something, it's more like a [Wanderer's Journal](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Wanderer%27s_Journal) (small <abbr title="Hollow Knight">HK</abbr> reference). A diary, where I'll be both technical about linux aspects but also theoretical, talking about how I felt using it.

## The Criterias

I'm obviously **NOT** gonna install every distro as my daily driver because I'd ~~suicide~~ after trying them all. I'll use the awesome [GNOME Boxes](https://apps.gnome.org/Boxes/) app to sandbox them.

Most people will say that to discover a distro's true features you need to use them completely and not for some specific tasks only. I'm okay with that, so I'll write some **criterias** to follow every time I'm trying a new distro.

What do I mean with criterias? Just a list of stuff to try out before actually giving a feedback about the distro itself. Some of those crieterias could be like

- Writing code
- Launching games
- Listening to music
- Other stuff (See [#suggestions](@/distropedia/_index.md#suggestions))

## Which Distros?

Obviously I can't try every linux distro on earth, so I'll select the most used ones + the ones anybody of you [requests](@/distropedia/_index.md#suggestions).

I'm open-minded to pretty much anything, so we'll begin with

- Debian
- Red Hat
- ~~Arch Linux~~

{% alert(note=true) %} 
Q: *Why not Arch?*
A: **It was my first distro** and I've used it for months. [Here](@/blog/2025-02-04-from-arch-to-fedora/index.md) I explain why I quit, but it's been a wonderful experience.
{% end %}

I'll then keep going with debian-based distros and so on with Red Hat/Arch-based too.

By the way there's also a [roadmap](@/distropedia/roadmap/index.md) if you want.

## Conclusion

On the sidebar the [Distropedia](@/distropedia/_index.md) tab should have appeared. That's where you'll find all the distros tried so far, a roadmap, and a link to this article.

Again, if you have any suggestions please [read this paragraph](@/distropedia/_index.md#suggestions) to understand how you can contribute.

{% alert(fact=true) %}
Thanks, really. This website is helping me going trough a lot of stuff. You probably can't notice trough an article all the troubles that somebody is living.

So I really appreciate who's here reading my blog light-heartedly. It supports me more than you can imagine.

See ya!
