<summary>Tracks</summary>

Hi! Interested in some tracks? Well... this time I've got some peak to share with you.

I listened to an album called [THE DEATH OF PEACE IN MIND](https://album.link/i/1647228197) by **Bad Omens**. I's a metal album and it has some really cool vocals, rythm and music overall. I often listen to this, it's one of my favorite metal albums. Gives you chills, I swear.

</details>

To be honest I need to show you what's been going on in my head this couple weeks, lemme know what you think about it.

## Tech Dilemma

{% alert (note=true) %}

This is a strictly personal section. If you're just interested about the review for the Nothing tech accessories I got, you're free to skip this part.

{% end %}

I already talked about this in another article, I know, but I'm disliking Apple. Or, I was? I'm not sure.

**iOS 26** came out recently and my iPhone has been going as smooth as butter since I updated it. I don't know how this is possible, but hey, seems like it is. I love liquid glass without all the Beta visual bugs I had, and it's making me think to **NOT** buy an Android.

But the reason I wanted an Android in the first place was because of the functionalities like APKs, torrents and such that are not a thing on an iPhone. So why am I having doubts now? The only thing I can think of is fear &mdash; Apple has an extremely comfortable **ecosystem**, and I'm also in love with the design. What I'm scared of is that I won't get the same treatment with Google services or self-hosting.

To me, **iCloud** still seems the best synchronization service so far. It works system-wide and frees up space on your device as it fills up with other stuff. I know Google has these things too, but it doesn't provide the same level of integration. Plus, their paid plans are absurd and apparently there's no self-hosted solution to replace iCloud and Google &mdash; with "Free up Space from Device" feature, I mean.

### My Approach

One thing led to another, and now I hate all phones. I mean, they're okay, but I figured out they take too much of my time on a daily basis. While with my laptop I'm able to do everything I need without distractions, my phone is a distraction itself. I use it even when I don't need to, and I'm not only talking about doomscrolling.

Maybe sometimes we don't need to go out with a phone, but our excuse is always "what if something happens?" &mdash; emergency situations. That's also why I still need a phone. So, knowing I can't get rid of it at all I still want to do something about it.

I'll get a cheaper phone (which means I need to quit Apple) and try to reduce my use of it trough ear buds, a smartwatch and so on. I'll explain why later.

## New Brand Focus

While thinking about this I've searched for a good brand that would still give me the feeling that Apple does. This is what I've found so far:

### Fairphone

![Fairphone](fairphone.webp#end#transparent#no-hover)

It's a great brand. I've looked into their **6th gen** for over a month and was convinced to get one.

Without going too much into the details it has 120hz, a great battery, pure Android 15, an "essentials" toggle on the side which I personally appreciate a lot, and many other features. They also give you the option to buy a de-googled Fairphone for `50€` less, with **/e/OS** installed. (not to my liking btw)

Sounded like a great phone, but a lot of people didn't recommend it to me and the main reason was the **camera**. One of the things I care about the most is the camera as I take a lot of pictures myself, especially on hikes. Camera, battery and overall design were what I was specifically looking for, and this didn't match the requirements anymore.

### Google Pixel

As much as I hate Google myself, this was a great option. The **Pixel Experience** is something unique, so it's the winner on **design**. Hardware doesn't miss anything either, but the price is really high with it being a popular and known phone *I guess*? Thing is, they have really high prices. I can't imagine myself anymore going around with a phone that costs more than `1000€`. New features come out every year anyway, and most of the times they aren't retroactive to older models.

### Nothing

> "it has heavy Teenage Engineering vibes lol" &mdash; [Daudix](https://daudix.one)

I've known Nothing phones since they first came out. They've always given tech vibes, and I also prefer **detailed designs** rather than simple and flat ones. The hardware is good quality, they have pretty nice cameras and the back lights/panels are no joke either.

## Accessories

As I said eariler I want to minimize my screen time as much as possible, to live life with my own eyes. But why do I have to deprive myself of modernity by not having my phone, or just not using it? I'll instead use the phone itself to my advantage.

### Earbuds

![CMF Buds](cmf-buds.webp#end#transparent#no-hover)

Last month I got a pair of **CMF Buds Pro 2**, by Nothing.

They are really comfortable as far as I can say, but I chose them for one specific reason &mdash; the **Smart Dial**. Their case has a little dial that can be either rotated to control the music **volume**, or pressed (with multiple gestures) to control playback.

That's already a step towards not having to pull my phone out every time I need to do something. I can keep it in my pocket, and I'll still be able to control my music from the case itself as if it was a remote. Awesome!

Obviously I'm also gonna mention that for a pair of buds that only cost `50€`, the features are endless. They have:

- Spatial Audio
- Noise Reduction + Transparency <small>(both amazing)</small>
- Customizable gestures
- Ultra Bass <small>(customizable)</small>
- Multi-device connectivity
- Customizable EQ
- In-ear Detection

You can read all about their specs on the website [itself](https://nothing.tech/products/cmf-buds-pro-2), I barely listed even half of the actual features these buds have.

I want to go even further though. The phone remaining in my pocket is *okay*, but what if I want to keep it in my schoolbag, or on the desk even if I'm far away?

### Smartwatch

![CMF Watch](cmf-watch.webp#end#transparent#no-hover)

Just a few weeks ago I managed to get myself a **CMF Watch 3 Pro**, again, by Nothing.

A lot of people see it as a waste, and I honestly understand their point. Why would you have a watch to do what you've always been able to do with just your phone?

The point doesn't stand though if what I'm trying to do is exactly **getting rid** of my phone.

With the success that the CMF buds had, I decided to go for another Nothing product. This time their smartwatch &mdash; and I must say, it surprised me.

Now let's go over the actual specs. This smartwatch is their latest model <small>(at time of writing)</small> and it currently has:

- Customizable watch faces
- Always On Display
- Notifications <small>(customizable)</small>
- Music control
- Heart rate, sleep, stress and blood oxygen tracking
- Power saving mode <small>(Battery can last 13 days)</small>
- Remote camera control
- Weather stats

Doesn't have an app store but it's more than okay, I personally think that apps on a smartwatch are ~~bullshit~~ anyway. If you want to me other features (again, I didn't mention them all) check them out on [their page](https://nothing.tech/products/cmf-watch-3-pro).

One thing I actually got surprised of is their compatibility &mdash; this is not my first smartwatch, I've had a Xiaomi band before and an actually pretty good Huawei smartwatch. The Xiaomi one being a band was very limited to a few features, but the Huawei one had plenty of 'em. The issue was **iOS**. Bound to an iPhone, it lost half of its utilities because of "incompatibility" while they were just being lazy. The most compatible device was a Huawei phone, *of course*.

I discovered then that a lot of brands do this think, **Apple included**. But this, it's the first time I see a device having **full compatibility** (exactly, none missing) with a phone very far from their own. Made me kind of happy, not gonna lie.

## Nothing Phone

Don't worry, I haven't got one yet. But I'm planning to.

Actually I'm kind of scared, because what if I don't like it and go back to using my iPhone? But that's another honestly, maybe I'm worrying too much. Oh and by the way, I'm probably gonna get a [Nothing 3](https://nothing.tech/products/phone-3).

## Conclusion

Maybe it's a little bit too early to review these devices but I've already used all of their features and they work great, so why not. In case there's any update you must be aware of I'll just publish another article about it.

Let me know what you think, and see you soon! {{ emoji(name="neofox_heart") }}
