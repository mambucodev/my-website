Hey, welcome back! I haven't posted for a while, and it's because I've been thinking about what to post about. I want to talk about big corporations this time such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and so on.

This blog post is different from the others. There's not a lot of text formatting. You'll feel like it's a novel, as it's supposed to be.

Please tho, tell me in the comments if you feel like this is boring. *I do need feedback afterall...*

## Prologue

I'll make a clear statement here: **I love Apple.** But not the way everybody does.

Most of the fossheads and android users see Apple fanboys as obsessed and ignorant about Apple's beauty and products.
I understand why, and most of them are right too, but I'm not one of those.

<small>Storytime!</small> Back in 2020 I was *still* an **Android** user, like most of the others. I was in middle school so I was really young and careless about which company had the best phones. Or at least, until I got more interested in tech.

My dad was the only iPhone user in my family, and it was pretty cool. I liked the UI (I don't appreciate old Android UIs) and it was really smooth. I eventually saved up some money and bought an **iPhone 13 Pro Max** in 2021.

Now it's been 3/4 years and I switched to Apple Music, iCloud (Mail and Drive), and all the other possible Apple subscriptions. *Note an important detail:* all subscriptions are part of the family bundle, mantained by **my father**. I don't have the money to keep all of those bills myself, so he cares about them. He also bought an iPhone to my mom lately, and my little brother inherited my dad's old one, so that we could all use the same services.

## Changing My Idea

As you may have read from my latest blog posts I'm really into tech lately, and for "really" I mean *"deeply"*. I'm using Linux daily, tweaking and customizing it repeatedly and I've got to the conclusion that an Android phone wouldn't be so bad.

I don't like Android itself because of its limited features. I would prefer to have a Linux phone with **GNOME Mobile**, with support for GTK apps and **waydroid**, a tool to download and run Android apps into Linux.

This would be so revolutionary, the power of a computer into a smartphone. Imagine using your package manager to install apps into your phone, or flexing the fact that you don't need to use a closed app source like Google Play Store or Apple's App Store to download apps. There's lots of open-source apps you can build and run everywhere on Linux.

But what would be the issue in buying an Android phone once my iPhone goes bad?

## iCloud's Loop

Last year, in 2024, I switched all my accounts to my @icloud.com address. This is because iCloud+ grants a few more features than the base Gmail plan and I liked the icloud suffix on the email too.

The only issue is, now that I want to switch somewhere else, I'll have to migrate more than 200 accounts to a new email address, which would be a big pain, but not impossible. But this isn't the major issue out there.

**Subscriptions.** They're the real problem. My father sustains the iCloud family bundle, and everything I have is syncronized to it. Apple doesn't allow syncing on Android, neither Linux. Also, I want coherence: I'd want an android phone to either sync to Google or some self-hosted service for better compatibility. I *could* keep using Apple Music because apart from everything else, I still prefer it over Spotify or any other music platform. But still, **how** am I gonna solve this problem?

My father would refuse to sustain a Google One subscription just for me, and he'd be totally right. I don't want to buy a new subscription myself, but I would totally invest in a self-hosted solution. I've been dreaming of a homeserver for a while, soooooo...

## The Homeserver

Actually, I'd be able to host a homeserver now. I just grab an old laptop (I have tons of old laptops), buy some RAM, an HDD and run it 24/7 with **NextCloud**. Why not? I don't really know.

There's a part of me that still loves Apple products, because they're always so smooth and work so well with each other. I would have loved to buy an Apple Watch, or some pair of AirPods, and most of us could admit they're the *best* products out there for their own category. These wishes won't come true if I ever buy an Android.

But this is not something I should be stressing all my nerves on right now, because I don't even have the money yet to buy a new phone and I won't need one for the next **2 years** probably. In the mean time, I'll just enjoy what I have.

## Conclusion

Apple is really nice, but the latest iPhones are just the same as their previous model and iOS feels really limited to me, a Linux user. I can't even sync my phone properly to my laptop, or install some quality apps (which often can't be uploaded to the App Store because of fees). I also don't like where the company itself is heading, it's like they're losing the moral pillars that Steve Jobs placed a few years ago.

On the other hand, Android need a lot of work and is not perfect either. It lacks some important features that Apple has, and **in my opinion** no UI will ever nearly be as good as iOS'.

This was a nice thought. Maybe in 2 years I'll read this article again and laugh, either with the latest iPhone model in my hands or with a linux phone, once GNOME Mobile gets decent.

This article is pretty old. I planned on publishing it 2 months ago but then I got distracted and forgot about it.

My opinion has changed overtime, and my hate towards Android has definitely ceased. I'll soon make a new blog post about iOS's new features, mentioning also its diversities with Android probably.
