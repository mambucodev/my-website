# What About Blogging?

I've been enjoying this blog recently. Oh... now that I think about it, why wasn't I enjoying this before?

<small>This was a cool ass introduction, admit it. {{ emoji(name="neofox_smug") }}</small>

Today, we're going to talk about the future direction of this website. I recognize that my intentions look really confused, and that's because they are. Not even I know what I want to do with it, I just started it because it *looked cool* and all but...

Anyways. Let's get into it step-by-step. {{ emoji(name="neofox_nom_fox") }}

Oh and, by the way, this is going to be a novel-like article like the previous one. Get used to it for a while, once I get better with text formatting and all.

## My Short Pause

I admit that I've been inactive for a few months... Meh, that happens.

I didn't mean to do it; it wasn't like I decided to stop blogging for a couple of months. I just got caught up in other things, such as school, anime and the fediverse.

The previous article itself was written **two months** ago, and was meant to be reviewed and published on that same day. But for some reason I just didn't feel like it, I didn't want to review it right away. In the end I *did* review it... yesterday.

<small>Oh, and a small cause of this is also because I'm terrible at making article banners. The first one was just a screenshot, and the second one was kindly made by [daudix](https://daudix.one) (btw thanks again).</small>

## Microblogging

If you think about it, I didn't actually **abbandon** blogging at all. During this "delay" I got kind of obsessed with the fediverse. I already loved microblogging in general, but the way Mastodon and ActivityPub in general work, they were fascinating. {{ emoji(name="neofox_googly_shocked") }}

I spent at least an hour a day on fedi, posting what I was either doing or just thinking about. It was a small, kind place, and I liked it. A few people started following me, even if not many, and I got to interact with them. So fun!

In the end I'm still microblogging. I even got an alt account just for my anime-related thoughts and opinions, and I'm satisfied with it. And this brings us to: **how is this blog going to procede?**

## A Blog Routine

I thought: "I need to think of a routine to follow everytime a new article has to come out." You know? It wouldn't actually be that bad if I managed to create some structure to apply whenever I were to write in my blog.

But then I came to think that, it's not me. I do like organizing, classifying my stuff and all. But this blog's intention is purely to get my creativity and my thoughts out of my head, and to share them with the rest of the world.

I'll probably have some routine anyway written somewhere inside my brain, but I'll try to be more chill about it. There's no deadlines, no publishers, nobody. This is just me sharing my opinions, and what happens in my daily life. 

## Conclusion

I'm going to do what I feel. Right now, I feel like I should care more about this blog, and this website in general. It's not something that everyone can do, and I **want** to be able to do this.

I must say there's one dream I have and I'm not ashamed of it, as egoistical it can be, and it's to have a big audience. I feel happy for every follower I get, every like I receive, and so on. So now the objectives are two now: expand my creativity and get people to know me.

It's probably also because of the idea of an *online identity* that I like blogging. I recognize that my actual social life isn't that great, because getting judged face-by-face is much more difficult than **opening yourself** online. My honest thoughts, what I enjoy, it's all written here. Nothing is hidden. And who likes what I write is probably going to keep following me, whoever doesn't will just ignore me. No consequences. {{ emoji(name="neofox_cofe") }}

By the way, thanks for the read. This was also some kind of venting I just did. It helped me discover what I want to do with all of this, and now both of us know it. I'm probably coming back soon, and spoiler: the next article is anime-related! {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

<small>By the way did you notice the emojis? They're so cute {{ emoji(name="neofox_melt_sob_heart") }} I just can't understand why wasn't I using them before.</small>
