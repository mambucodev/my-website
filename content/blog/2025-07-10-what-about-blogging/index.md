I've been enjoying this blog recently. Oh... now that I think about it, why wasn't I enjoying this before? <small>This was a cool ass introduction, admit it. {{ emoji(name="neofox_smug") }}</small>

Today, we're going to talk about the future direction of this website. I recognize that my intentions look really confused, and that's because they are. Not even I know what I want to do with it, I just started it because it *looked cool* and all but...

Anyways. Let's get into it step-by-step. {{ emoji(name="neofox_nom_fox") }}

Oh and, by the way, this is going to be a novel-like article like the previous one. Get used to it for a while, once I get better with text formatting and all.

## My Short Pause

I admit that I've been inactive for a few months... Meh, that happens.

I didn't mean to do it; it wasn't like I decided to stop blogging for a couple of months. I just got caught up in other things, such as school, anime and the fediverse.

The previous article itself was written **two months** ago, and was meant to be reviewed and published on that same day. But for some reason I just didn't feel like it, I didn't want to review it right away. In the end I *did* review it... yesterday.

<small>Oh, and a small cause of this is also because I'm terrible at making article banners. The first one was just a screenshot, and the second one was kindly made by [daudix](https://daudix.one) (thanks again btw).</small>

## Microblogging

If you think about it, I didn't actually **abbandon** blogging at all. During this "delay" I got kind of obsessed with the fediverse. I already loved microblogging in general, but the way Mastodon and ActivityPub in general work, they were fascinating. {{ emoji(name="neofox_googly_shocked") }}

I spent at least an hour a day on fedi, posting whatever I was doing or thinking about. It was a small, kind place, and I liked it. A few people started following me, even if not many, and I got to interact with them. So fun!

In the end I'm still microblogging. I even got an alt account just for my anime-related thoughts and opinions, and I'm satisfied with it.

But this brings us to: **how is this blog going to procede?**

## A Blog Routine

I thought: 'I need to think of a routine to follow every time a new article is due.' You know? It wouldn't be that bad if I could create a structure to apply whenever I write a blog post.

But then I realised that, it's not me. I do like organising and classifying my things. However, the intention behind this blog is purely to express my creativity and share my thoughts with the rest of the world.

I'll probably have a routine of some kind written somewhere in my brain anyway, but I'll try to be more relaxed about it. There are no deadlines, no publishers, no one. This is just me sharing my opinions and what happens in my daily life.

## Conclusion

I'm going to follow my instincts. Right now, I feel like I should care more about this blog and the website as a whole. Not everyone can do this, and I want to be able to.

I must say, I have one dream and I'm not ashamed of it, no matter how egotistical it may seem: I want to have a big audience. I'm happy for every follower I get and every like I receive. My objectives now are twofold: to expand my creativity and to get to know people.

I probably like blogging because of the idea of an *online identity*. I recognise that my actual social life isn't that great because being judged face-to-face is much more difficult than opening yourself up **online**. All my honest thoughts and what I enjoy are written here. Nothing is hidden. Those who like what I write will probably keep following me; those who don't will just ignore me. There are no consequences. {{ emoji(name="neofox_cofe") }}

By the way, thanks for reading. This was also me just venting. It helped me figure out what I want to do, and now we both know. I'll probably be back soon â€“ spoiler alert: the next article is anime-related! {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

<small>By the way did you notice the emojis? They're so cute {{ emoji(name="neofox_melt_sob_heart") }} I just can't understand why wasn't I using them before.</small>
