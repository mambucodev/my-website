# Mambuco's Blog

Welcome to my **blogging** corner! {{ emoji(name="neofox_aww") }}

I post a lot of interesting stuff, I swear. See, we've got a lot of categories: Tech, Anime, or just my personal thoughts and life experiences.
I'd also like to write about my city (Rome) one day, once I get to appreciate it enough.

By the way, scroll, read whatever you want, and if you've got an ActivityPub account you can leave a comment too!
