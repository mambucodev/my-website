Hey, welcome to the Distropedia! This section of the website is slowly growing as my side project.

If you're interested on what's the purpose of the Distropedia or want to know how I came up with this idea, [read this](@/blog/2025-03-26-my-new-distropedia/index.md).

{% alert(note=true) %}
I'm sorry but lately I don't have much time to work on this project. It will go on, but slowly.

Update: This website section hasn't been updated since it was created. I will surely bring this project to life, just not now. **I'm sorry for the hype.**

    <summary>What will you find here?</summary>
    In case you didn't want to read the link above, I understand. That's why I'm here explaining in a nutshell <strong>why does this page exist</strong>. Basically I started this fun project where I sandbox a distro, try most of the features that a common OS should have and then write a review about it. That's why below there's a a few distros (they are actually buttons). If you click on them, you'll end up on their review page.

## Distros

Here's all the distros I've tried and reviewed so far. Hopefully they can help somebody his way trough the distro they prefer. Click on one to read their review.

            <strong>Arch Linux</strong>
            <p>A rolling-release lightweight distro.</p>

<small>I know, they're not much yet. Just... Just give me some time, okay?</small>

## Suggestions

If you want to support this idea you could eventually suggest new distros to try out and **why**.

I'm slowly expanding the [roadmap](@/distropedia/roadmap/index.md) with genuine distros, that don't have much in common with others. That's the reason why I'll ask *Why should I review this distro?* on every incoming suggestion. For example, I'll never review **Kubuntu** (sorry) because it's just Ubuntu with a different DE.

By the way, you can suggest in many ways. You can either contact me or open an issue on GitHub.
