I build websites and web applications — from simple landing pages to full-stack apps with databases and auth. If you need something built, let's talk.

## Packages

<div class="service-grid">

<div class="service card">
<span class="service-price">From 30€</span>
<strong>Static Site</strong>
<p>A landing page, portfolio, or blog. Clean, fast, fully responsive. No backend needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="service card">
<span class="service-price">From 80€</span>
<strong>Web Application</strong>
<p>A dynamic site with a backend, database, authentication, and whatever features you need.</p>
</div>

<div class="service card">
<span class="service-price">Let's talk</span>
<strong>Custom Project</strong>
<p>Something else entirely? CLI tool, API, automation, bot — I'm open to it.</p>
</div>

</div>

## Hosting

<div class="service card hosting-card">
<span class="service-price">3–5€/month</span>
<strong>Managed Hosting</strong>
<p>I run my own infrastructure on a dedicated server. I'll deploy, maintain, and monitor your project. Includes SSL. Game servers or heavier workloads are possible too, priced separately.</p>
</div>
