## Pricing

<details>
<summary>My Fiverr Profile</summary>

I also own a **Fiverr** profile. Prices are way higher there, but I prefer way more to have business with you trough Fiverr if the project we're talking about is in large scale.

This is to guarantee you'll receive your website on time, trough a verified platform, and that I receive the full payment.

Believe me, it's a really famous platform for freelancers, and you can definitely trust it more than you'd trust making a private transaction to me, without any intermediates.

This is my Fiverr profile below ↓

Pricing can vary very easily. In my opinion, websites are not something to be classified, because a very simple website can still be capable of having a strong impact on its visitors. That's why I usually recommend that people contact me beforehand and we discuss the price together.

**But**, in case you need some reference, here's how much I would make somebody pay for a website:

### Simple Website

A static website, can either be personal or your project's showcase. A "simple" web page doesn't lack any content, but you're not going to get the features you'd expect from a dynamic website.

**Price:** From <mark>5$</mark> to <mark>15$</mark>; depends on how much content.

### Advanced Website

A dynamic website (as mentioned before) that can have all types of features. Database calls, a login system, a forum, they're all much easier to integrate.

**Price:** From <mark>15$</mark> to <mark>50$</mark>.

**Hosting:** If you despise deploying on Vercel, and you don't have your own hosting resources, I can provide ↓

## Hosting

I own a dedicated server and don't use it too much. That's why I'd be happy to host any kind of website for <mark>1-2$/month</mark> +  required database/external services will be an extra charge.

In case it's not a website but rather a game server (e.g. Minecraft) or anything else, don't hesitate. Note tho that it will have a higher price than website hosting, as it may have a larger impact on server resources.

## Anything Else?

I mean, I **am** a programmer and I know other stuff rather than just web development. Feel free to contact me for any tech-related commission, and I'll tell you if I'm rather capable to fulfill your request or not.
